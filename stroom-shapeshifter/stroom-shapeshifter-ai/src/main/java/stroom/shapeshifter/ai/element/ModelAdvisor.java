/**
 * The node's advisor (design 01 §10, §12 item 6): a model document's chat model, asked the questions of
 * {@link QuestionText} — the words the live smoke measured — after the system text and the attempt's
 * transcript so far, so the model sees the whole dialogue. Every invocation is audited against the
 * Shapeshifter AI document with the model, the kind of question, the tokens charged and the outcome,
 * as A9 requires of a change nobody watches; the sample itself is not written to the audit, since A17's
 * redaction is not built and the audit is not the place to leak what it would redact. Transport retries
 * are the chat model's own (the client retries a dropped connection before this sees it), so a 503 is not
 * a failed candidate; the attempt's budgets are the dialogue's, fed by {@link #tokensUsed()}.
 * <p>
 * No response cache stands between this and the model: a re-ask with the same words must reach the model,
 * which is the cache-bypass §10 asks for.
