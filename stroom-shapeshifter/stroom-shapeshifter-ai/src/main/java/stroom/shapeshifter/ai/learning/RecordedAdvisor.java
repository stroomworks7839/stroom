/// produced — the chain, the boundary, the records, the targets, each element's configuration and output
/// — because all of it follows from the sample and the answers, both of which are kept. What the model
/// said is a record; what running produced is a consequence, and consequences are cheaper to re-derive

/// given only to the question the record says it answered, and a walk that asks anything else has
/// diverged and is refused (see [ReplayDiverged]). An attempt that resumes therefore either reaches the
/// state it stopped in or says it could not, and never binds a configuration learned from a mixture of
