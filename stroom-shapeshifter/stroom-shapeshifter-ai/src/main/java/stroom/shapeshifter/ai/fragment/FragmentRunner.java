/// pipeline — the real elements, the real pools, the real filters — and is what a node uses, so that
/// what is judged is what will run. [StandInFragmentRunner] walks the chain with the module's step
/// runners instead, which needs no node, no stores beyond the content ones and no pipeline scope, and is
/// what the Tier 1 scenarios run on (design 02 §2).
///
/// They are meant to agree, and where they do not the pipeline is right. A Tier 2 scenario holds them to
/// the same events on the same fragment and input, because a stand-in that has drifted from the thing it
/// stands in for is worse than no stand-in: it would pass a candidate the pipeline refuses.
