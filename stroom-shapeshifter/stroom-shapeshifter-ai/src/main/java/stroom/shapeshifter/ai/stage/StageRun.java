/**
 * Everything a scenario asserts on after one run (design 02 §1).
 *
 * @param doc            The document as it stands afterwards: the routing table rewritten if a promotion
 *                       happened, otherwise as given.
 * @param decision       What was decided.
 * @param shape          The stream's shape under the document's learning key, as the ledger keys it.
 * @param bindings       What produced the output (design 01 §7.3 rule 3); null when there is none.
 * @param output         What the bound or promoted fragment produced over the whole stream; null for a
 *                       sentinel or a given-up shape.
 * @param verdicts       The scorecard's verdicts on the fragment over the whole stream, one per step, in
 *                       chain order; empty when nothing ran.
 * @param transcript     Every exchange with the model, oldest first; empty when it was not consulted.
 * @param events         The same output as the events the fragment emitted making it, for a caller with
 *                       a downstream to play them on to — which is how the supervisor element serves a
 *                       stream without running the fragment a second time. Null where the fragment was
 *                       run by something with no pipeline under it, as Tier 1 runs it, and where
 *                       nothing ran at all.
 * @param diagnostics    What the fragment's elements said making that output, for a caller that must
 *                       put them on the pipeline's error stream (A20). A fragment runs under an error
 *                       receiver of its own, so that a candidate's complaints reach the model rather
 *                       than the operator; the one run that is served has to be heard, and these are
 *                       what it said. Empty where nothing ran or nothing is served.
