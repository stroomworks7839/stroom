/**
 * The prompt contract of design 01 §10 as text: what a model is told before its first answer, and how
 * each typed question is put — in the words of the document's conversation (§10.2). Every question carries
 * the stage's objective and the document's instructions (the system text), the sample and the learning
 * key's values, the real input the element will receive, the previous configuration on a re-ask, and the
 * feedback that lost the marks. For extraction it carries the mandatory {@code xsi:schemaLocation} and
 * the {@code ignoreErrors} prohibition (§9.1); for transformation, the schema's named failure modes
 * (§8.2) and the degeneracy trap (§8.3). The reply grammar is stated on every question.
 * <p>
 * This class computes the blocks a template's variables stand for — {@code ${feedback}} is the whole
 * "what fell short" list or nothing — and {@link Templates} fills them in. Where a node's advisor over
 * {@code stroom-ai} (§12 item 6) and the live harness agree on what is said, so that the harness
 * measures the prompt the node will use.
