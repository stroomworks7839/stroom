/**
 * Yield (design §8.4): output records per unit of input, scored as how close the ratio comes to the
 * expected one — {@code min(actual, expected) / max(actual, expected)}, so too many records lose marks
 * as too few do. A record is a child element of the output's root, which is what both {@code records:2}
 * and {@code event-logging:3} documents make of one. Applies to a step that produced XML; when the basis
 * is input records and the input is not XML, there is nothing to count against, and the scorer does
 * not apply.
