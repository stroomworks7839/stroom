/// Design 02 §5, scenario 51: **one document, any format, any feed.**
///
/// Every format scenario before this one narrows `allowedElements` to the single parser its format
/// needs — `DSParser` for the text formats, `JSONParser` for JSON — so none of them asks the question
/// this one does: given every parser it might use, does the stage *choose* the right one for the feed in
/// front of it, and learn something that scores?
///
/// That is what a person setting this up actually has. They do not know what the next feed will be, so
/// they cannot narrow the list; they configure one document and point feeds at it. This scenario is
/// that document, and it is the configuration the demo content pack ships — proved here first, so the
/// pack is a thing that has been seen to work rather than a plausible arrangement of settings.
///
/// Four feeds, four formats, four shapes, four rules, each serving its own traffic: delimited text with
/// a header, JSON lines, syslog in two forms, and fixed-width columns with nothing to split on. One
/// learning key, one plan, one set of scorers.
///
/// **What a scripted model can and cannot prove.** The replies here are canned, so the *choice* of
/// parser is this scenario's and not a model's. What is proved is everything around that choice: that
/// the chain question offers the whole list, that the split question is shaped for the input kind that
/// follows from it, that a `JSONParser` is asked for no configuration while a `DSParser` is, that one
/// scorer set judges all four, and that each promotes on its own evidence and writes its format's
/// golden events. Whether a model picks well from that list is the live run's to answer (design 03
/// §2, phase B), and this scenario is what makes that run worth doing.
