/// Design 01 §12 item 2: the run that is judged is the run that is served, and a [StageRun] carries the
/// events of *its own* run or none at all.
///
/// A fragment runner keeps one run's events and the next run replaces them, so the events have to be
/// taken in the call that made the run. A judgement made over the element runners — which is how a chain
/// is judged as it is learned, before it has been written as a fragment — made no run and must carry
/// nothing, or it takes whatever the runner happens to be holding: a variant tried and rejected earlier
/// in the same call, or an earlier stream of the same pipeline scope.
///
/// One stage over three streams, since a stage's runner is a stage's: a shape learned, the same shape
/// served, and then a second shape learned behind it.
