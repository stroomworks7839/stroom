    public static final String INSTRUCTIONS = """
            You are configuring a Stroom pipeline stage that turns raw machine-generated records into \
            Stroom event-logging XML.

            The output must validate against the event-logging schema in the EVENTS schema group. \
            Every event needs an EventTime/TimeCreated in ISO 8601 with a timezone, an EventSource that \
            names the system the record came from, and an EventDetail whose typed element says what \
            happened — Authenticate, Process, View, Create, Delete and so on.

            Prefer a typed element to a generic one. Where a record names a user, put it in \
            EventSource/User/Id rather than in a Data element; the same goes for the host, the device \
            and the file or document a record is about. Use Data elements only for values the schema \
            has no home for, and never emit an event whose detail is Unknown when the record says what \
            happened.

            Keep the whole record. If a field cannot be placed, carry it as a named Data element rather \
            than dropping it. Do not invent values that the record does not contain, and do not \
            normalise an identifier into something prettier than what was logged.
