# The XML head-to-head: pipeline XSLT vs shapeshifter, planned

Status: **phased plan, for sign-off**. Written 2026-08-21; nothing implemented.

## The question, stated fairly

Parse XML, transform, write XML — 1M unique records. The incumbent is Stroom's own shape:
a real XML parser (SAX), a `SplitFilter` (count 1000) to bound memory, XSLT, an XML writer.
The challenger is a shapeshifter configuration doing the same whole job.

The hypothesis is *not* that shapeshifter out-parses a dedicated XML parser — it will not.
It is that the incumbent pays for parse → **event/tree handoff → XSLT walk → re-serialise**,
while shapeshifter goes bytes-in → match+capture → emit bytes in one pass with no
intermediate representation, and that skipping the middle beats the specialist's parsing
edge. The benchmark exists to find out which effect is bigger, and by how much.

## What the reconnaissance found

- `stroom-pipeline` `TestSplitFilter` assembles real pipeline elements with plain
  `setTarget()` chaining and drives them with `ProcessorUtil.processXml(input,
  errorReceiver, chain, locationFactory)` — no injection container. `SplitFilter` is
  configured with `setSplitDepth`/`setSplitCount` directly. This is the harness spine.
- `XsltFilter` appears in tests only under `stroom-app` (`F2XTestUtil`), with heavier
  wiring (stores, pools, pipeline context). Whether it can be stood up without the app
  module's Guice is Phase 0's first question; the honest fallback is Saxon driven directly
  (`TransformerHandler` in the same SAX chain) — the same engine Stroom runs, minus
  Stroom's element plumbing, and the write-up would say exactly that.
- `TestXMLWriter` shows the writer usable standalone.

## Phases

**Phase 0 — wiring spike.** Stand up the full chain once, tiny input: SAX parse →
`SplitFilter(depth from schema, count 1000)` → XSLT → `XMLWriter` → counting byte sink.
Decide: Stroom `XsltFilter` if it wires without the app module, Saxon `TransformerHandler`
otherwise (recorded as a disclosed substitution). Decide module placement — proposal: a new
test-only module `stroom-shapeshifter-xmlbench` depending on `stroom-pipeline` and the
engine, so the engine module's dependencies stay clean. Exit criterion: bytes out equal a
hand-checked golden for ten records.

**Phase 1 — the corpus.** A committed, seeded *generator* (never the file): 1M records,
each unique — sequential id, hash-derived user/host values, varying optional fields, text
containing XML escapes (`&amp;`, `&lt;`) so both sides must handle escaping honestly, and
varied field order across record kinds so the transform cannot cheat positionally. Sizes as
a benchmark parameter: 10k / 100k / 1M (~2.5 MB / 25 MB / 250 MB). The transform job:
realistic normalisation — records → events, an attribute promoted to an element, two fields
concatenated, one dropped, one renamed — expressible in XSLT and in shapeshifter without
favouring either. Golden output committed at 10k; larger sizes verified by digest.

**Phase 2 — the baseline, decomposed.** JMH in single-shot mode (whole-file ops), few
forks, sizes as params, results to `design/benchmarks/` as always. Three rows, so the
comparison teaches where time goes, not just who wins:
1. parse → write (no split, no XSLT): the floor — what the XML machinery alone costs;
2. parse → split(1000) → identity XSLT → write: the plumbing tax;
3. parse → split(1000) → real XSLT → write: **the incumbent**.
Also a memory note: the run that justifies `SplitFilter` (real XSLT, no split, 1M) is
attempted once and its failure or heap use recorded — the reason the split exists deserves
evidence, not folklore.

**Phase 3 — the challenger.** A shapeshifter configuration for the same job: strict
dispatch (D36 idiom — anchored record template, field templates, eaters for structural
lines), captures → the same target XML emitted directly. The escape question is answered
honestly: values carrying `&amp;` must survive to the output identically, however the
config achieves it. Parity gate before any measurement: byte-identical to the incumbent's
output at 10k (golden), digest-equal at 1M. If byte parity founders on XSLT serializer
whitespace, the parity criterion is renegotiated *before* measuring, not after.

**Phase 4 — the measurement.** Same-run A/B, quiet box, drift controls, five-fork or
single-shot-many-iterations as Phase 2's variance dictates. Recorded win, lose, or split —
including the decomposition: if shapeshifter beats row 3 but not row 1, the hypothesis is
confirmed exactly as stated (the middle, not the parser, was the incumbent's cost). Losses
feed the performance queue (the first-byte table is the obvious lever) rather than
disappearing.

## Open decisions for sign-off

1. Module placement: new `stroom-shapeshifter-xmlbench` test module (proposed) vs living in
   `stroom-app`'s test tree beside `F2XTestUtil`.
2. `XsltFilter`-with-wiring vs Saxon-direct if Phase 0 finds the filter needs the app
   module (proposal: Saxon-direct with disclosure).
3. The record schema and transform job above — right shape, right difficulty?
4. Parity criterion: byte-identical (proposed) vs canonicalised-equal.
