/**
 * What a supervised stage did with the stream at the cursor (A30, design 01 §11.7): the stage pane's
 * contents, built from the {@code StageRun} the element made.
 * <p>
 * A supervisor has no single document to show as code — the Shapeshifter AI document is edited in its
 * own editor — and what a person selecting it needs to see is not text but the decision: which shape
 * this stream has, which rule matched, what was bound, what the scorers made of it, and what was said
 * to the model where it was learned. The fragment and the document are carried as {@link DocRef}s so
 * that the pane can offer them as links rather than as names.
