/**
 * The pipeline's tree with the elements an element ran <em>inside</em> itself hung beneath it (A30,
 * design 01 §11.7).
 * <p>
 * Some elements are not one step but several. A supervised stage runs a whole learned chain over what it
 * is given and emits what came out of the far end, so from outside it is one element with a stream going
 * in and events coming out. This is what opens it: the chain's own elements, beneath the stage, where a
 * person debugging the pipeline already looks.
 * <p>
 * They are not in the pipeline. Nothing here touches the model: the elements come from the last step's
 * answer, they last only as long as that answer does, and the pipeline a person saves is the one they
 * drew. What is nested is only known once the pipeline has <em>run</em> — which chain a stage ran
 * depends on the stream in front of it — so it cannot be in the structure, and this is why the stepper
 * builds its own tree rather than showing the structure editor's.
