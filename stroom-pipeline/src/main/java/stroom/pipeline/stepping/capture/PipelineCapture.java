/// What a pipeline build needs in order to capture each element's input and output: somewhere to
/// register a monitor per element, a record detector to drive, and something to tell at the end of each
/// record. [PipelineFactory][stroom.pipeline.factory.PipelineFactory] wraps every steppable element with
/// recorders when it is given one of these, and links them to the monitors held here.
///
/// [SteppingController] is the implementation stepping uses: it persists each record's IO to the step
/// data store and answers a person's step by reading it back. [HeadlessCapture] is the implementation
/// for everything else — a supervisor judging a candidate, a harness scoring a chain — which keeps what
/// it captured in memory and never involves a session, a store or a step request.
///
/// The seam exists because capture and stepping are not the same thing (§12 item 2 of the Shapeshifter
/// AI design): running a pipeline and reading what each element made of its input is useful wherever
/// something needs to judge a configuration, and until this was extracted the only way to do it was to
/// be a stepping session.
