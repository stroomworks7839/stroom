/// Capture without stepping: run a pipeline over an input and keep what each element made of it, in
/// memory, for whoever asked (§12 item 2 of the Shapeshifter AI design).
///
/// This is [SteppingController]'s other half. Stepping needs a session, a step request, a durable store
/// and a person waiting; judging a configuration needs none of those — it needs the pipeline run and
/// each element's input and output handed back. Both are captures, which is why they now share
/// [PipelineCapture] and the recorders the build wraps elements with.
///
/// What it keeps is one entry per record, holding every monitored element's input and output as text —
/// SAX output rendered as XML exactly as the stepper renders it for a person, so that what a supervisor
/// judges is what a person would have read — and whatever that element logged while producing it.
///
/// Two things to know before using it:
///
/// - **It holds everything it captures.** There is no store behind it, so a capture is for a *sample*,
///   not for a production stream of a million records. [#setMaxRecords] caps it; past the cap the parse
///   runs on but nothing more is kept, and [#isTruncated] says so.
/// - **One capture is one run.** It is handed to the build rather than looked up, so a caller that runs
///   two pipelines takes two of these; nothing about it is scoped to the pipeline it captured.
/// - **A reader's input needs a highlight.** An element whose recorder reports what it read by source
///   span — the readers above the parser, and so a parser's own input — gives back nothing unless
///   something is tracking the record's position in the source. Parsers, filters and writers capture
///   their output regardless, and that is what a configuration is judged on.
