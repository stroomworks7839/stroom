/// Stepping has always been able to do this — a person edits the code in the stepper and the pipeline
/// runs with their edit rather than what is stored — but until now the only way to say so was to be a
/// stepping session, since the factory read the code from the stepping request. Anything else wanting to
/// run a configuration that is not in the store had to fake a session or write the document first, and
/// writing before running is what a supervisor that judges a candidate before promoting it must not do.

/// the stepper from the person's edits, the Shapeshifter AI supervisor from a candidate it is judging.
